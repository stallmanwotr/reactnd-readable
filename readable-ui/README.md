# readable-ui

## Getting Started

This application requires that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed, which provides
the npm (node package manager) command.

The backend server should also be running (_../api-server_). If successful you should be able
to see the REST interface detailed here:

<div>
    http://localhost:3001/
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 20px">
    http://localhost:3001/
</div>

Next install the application dependencies, as follows:

<pre>
$ npm install
</pre>

And finally start the UI application itself:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ npm start

Use a browser to navigate to here:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://localhost:8080/
