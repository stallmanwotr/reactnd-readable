# readable-ui

## Getting Started

This application requires that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed, which provides
the npm (node package manager) command.

The backend server should also be running (_../api-server_). If successful you should be able
to see the REST interface detailed here:

<pre>
    http://localhost:3001/
</pre>

Next install the application dependencies, as follows:

<pre>
    $ npm install
</pre>

And finally start the UI application itself:

<pre>
    $ npm start
</pre>

Use a browser to navigate to here:

<pre>
    http://localhost:8080/
</pre>
